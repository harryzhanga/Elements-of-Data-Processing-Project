# Elements-of-Data-Processing-Project
My project for the subject: Elements of Data Processing

This was my project, it is about Predicting House Prices in Victoria

- The training data was taken by web scraping some property sites
- Other data was taken from open datasets like Kaggle


- The program asks you to input some information about a house and it will return the neighbours and the predicted price for that house
- Hence, it uses k-nearest-neighbours

- Thanks!
